== Architecture Tests

The use-case this example intends to demonstrate is as follows:

There is a library that defines architecture rules with ArchUnit called `arch-tests`

Another module `my-module` should follow these architecture rules.

This can be achieved by applying the `arch-unit-tests` plugin and adding the `arch-tests` maven coordinates as follows:

[source,kotlin]
----
architectureTest {
    tests.set(listOf("dev.mrbergin.aut.examples:arch-tests"))
}
----

The tests can now be run with the `architectureTest` task, resulting in a test output just like a regular `test` task.

In this case, the project `arch-tests` has a test which enforces all packages reside in the `dev.mrbergin` package, and `my-module` gains access to these via the code block outlined above.
